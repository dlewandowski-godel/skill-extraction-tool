1.I want to create new project.
Skill extraction tool. An app that reads a new employee's CV and IFU, extracts skills and saves them in a structured format.
For frontend use React, typescript, mui and tanstack query. Try to use composition and tanstack query for state management.
For backend use .net 10, MediatR,ef core, clean architecture with Commands and use DDD. Ask clarifying questions. Create docker-compose that allows to run everything with a single command docker-compose up. For db use postgres. I want unit tests for both frontend and backend. I want an admin panel. I want simple login and 2 roles: Admin and User. Add some pretty graphs for admin view.
I want to have at least several pages, routing. I want to first create a backlog of epics and user stories. Then I will work on them 1 by 1 with you.

2.I want you generate this backlog as folders and files in this project. I also want a way of ticking them off so I could see what is done

3. start working on epic-1. After you're done with a single user story, build and run the tests. If that fails, fix them. if everything works, move on to the next user story. finish this way entire epic 1.
4. start working on epic-1. After you're done with a single user story, build and run the tests. If that fails, fix them. if everything works, move on to the next user story. finish this way entire epic 1.
5. we need a register functoinality for frontend and backend as well for normal users. Also there is a lot of errors. fix them.
6. How to manually test this epic?
7. start working on epic-4. After you're done with a single user story, build and run the tests. If that fails, fix them. if everything works, move on to the next user story. finish this way entire epic 4. after that make sure you've implemented everything.
